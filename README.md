This is an Angular Starter Kit for bootstrapping Angular applications.

The process of installing this kit is by typing the following commands in the terminal:

1. Run "npm install".
2. Run "bower install".

After this, the only thing needed to be changed is the base href in the index.html of the application.

Run "gulp" to start the server.
Run "gulp build" to build the application in a "dist" folder.
